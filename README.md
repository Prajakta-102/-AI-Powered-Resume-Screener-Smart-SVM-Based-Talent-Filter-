## 📌 Problem Statement
Recruiters face the overwhelming task of shortlisting resumes from thousands of applicants, making the hiring process time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone. Traditional resume screening lacks automation and often leads to potential talent being overlooked.

## 🎯 Objective of the Project:
To build an intelligent Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model that automatically analyzes and classifies resumes into relevant job categories. This model aims to streamline the hiring pipeline by filtering resumes efficiently based on textual content.

## 🎯 Key Goals of the Model
Text Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the resume data for vectorization using NLP techniques.

Vectorization: Convert resume text into numerical form using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Encoding Labels: Encode job categories for model training.

Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset for training and evaluation.

SVM Model Building: Use Support Vector Machine for multi-class classification of resumes.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Model Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for improved performance.

Business Impact: Save recruiter time, improve shortlisting accuracy, and enhance the candidate experience through faster decisions.
